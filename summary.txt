Project Name:
Advanced Algorithms for Solving Travelling Salesman Problem

Project Description:
This project implemented four advanced algorithms to solve the famous 
NP-Problem Travelling Salesman Problem. The program prompts the user to
select which algorithm to carry out, which city to implement the algorithm on,
and the cut-off time of the algorithm. Then the program will implement the algorithm
on the desginated city, and outcome a path that travels each location in the city exactly once,
with a corresponding total distance travelled. The path, total distance travelled and calculation traces
will be ouput to two different files in the root directory.

Project Work Breakdown:
Ruo Yu is responsible for handling files. He wrote the FileInput.java, City.java and Location.java to process
raw data into useful information that is going to be used in program.

Hezijian is responsible for designing the entry interface, implementing all the algorithms and creating unit tests, including Main.java,
Algorithm.java, BranchAndBound.java, City.java, FarthestInsert.java, Iteratedlocalsearch.java, SimulatedAnnealing.java and ProjectTest.java.

README.md and summary.txt are written by Hezijian.
